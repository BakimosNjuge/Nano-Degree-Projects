### Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

### What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

* **Learn how to submit projects for review** 
* **Practice JSON parsing to a model object** 
* **Design an activity layout**
* **Populate all fields in the layout accordingly**

# Project Two Popular Movie Stage 1.

### Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1.

In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

### You app will:

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title

movie poster image thumbnail
A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)
release date
